The "Birthday Problem Simulation" is a Python GUI application using the Tkinter library. It simulates the probability of shared birthdays in a group of people. Users can add individuals to the group, and the app displays their birthdays and the likelihood of at least one shared birthday. The interface includes a list of added birthdays, detected duplicates, and statistics on the number of people added. Additionally, it features a colorful table showing the occurrences of birthdays for each day and month, updating dynamically as people are added. The project is a visually engaging and interactive way to explore the famous birthday problem, demonstrating the increased likelihood of shared birthdays as more people are added to a group.
